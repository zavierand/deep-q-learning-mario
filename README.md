# Reinforcement Learning using Deep-Q-Networks on Mario
This README will be updated as the project is built out.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to reimplement the [existing paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) on deep-q-networks for reinforcement learning by [DeepMind](https://deepmind.google). Mario was the chosen video game between these because for my parents growing up, they would always visit the arcade and play either Pacman or Donkey Kong. I have internal beef with Donkey Kong, so I decided to roll with Mario - given as well, the discrete spaces for these two games were very similar with both having 18 actions that can be quantified into a discrete space.
